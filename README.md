### Intro

This is my first standalone project on Flutter that I worked on as part of a *tech jam*, I haven't completed it yet but the UI has mostly been implemented. I will complete this project sometime in the future, it was mostly a learning experience to apply the skills that I learned from taking a course on Flutter over the course of two months.

While the UI looks good, the app doesn't have much functionality as yet. Features that I'll be looking to implement on the application in the future:
- Caching using SharedPreferences or SQLite
- Possible Firebase linking; user accounts with online data storage
- More complete animations
- Search functionality
- More integrated API linkage (see chopper package)
- YouTube API linking to view trailers within app
- Infinite Scrolling on home screen (paging)

Working on the features above will help me learn a lot of the skills that I'm looking to gain. I'll aim to complete this application using the Provider pattern, but I'd like to start looking into other patterns and perhaps consider changing if a better solution comes up.

### Notes and Musings

This was a very enjoyable project to implement, it didn't take me very long at all after following a well taught Flutter course. However, I'm still lacking the real functionality that I'm looking for in this application, I hope to complete the course while reading up further on Flutter and eventually come back and complete this project.123

I want to learn to work with animations, that's one concept that I've found truly challenging to grasp. Other concepts such as State and Asynchronity are somewhat easier to grasp but I still have a lot to learn in regards to the two.
